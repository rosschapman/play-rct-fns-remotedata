# Architectural Decision Records (one-liners version)

Some thoughts sketched out while developing to self-guide the process:

1. Colocate tests with source files
2. Exporting functions just for testing is great
3. Add Typescript
4. Don't worry too much about typing the Google stuff perfectly
5. Fix annoying "break" lint errors another time
6. Colocate Props|State type definitions above component class
7. Give Storybook a try
8. Don't try and learn RTL
9. Focus on backend things first
10. You don't have to test everything probably?

1. Colocate tests with source files
2. Exporting functions just for testing is great
3. Add Typescript
4. Fix annoying "break" lint errors another time
5. Colocate Props|State type definitions above component class
6. Give Storybook a try
7. Don't try and learn RTL
8. Focus on backend things first
9. You don't have to test everything probably?
